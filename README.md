# üõçÔ∏è AI Live Host Demo ‚Äì LLAMA Hackathon 2025

This demo spins up **Lisa**, your AI-powered live shopping host, designed to empower sellers of all sizes to run engaging, real-time shopping streams ‚Äî with zero on-camera presence needed.

## üî• Background

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/19/ai-humans-in-china-just-proved-they-are-better-influencers.html Just last week, A Chinese entrepreneur raked in $7.65 million after streaming using an interactive digital avatar.

Live shopping has become a powerful commerce channel. Platforms like **TikTok Shop** have proven this by generating **$1.5M GMV in a single live session**. However, many small or emerging sellers struggle to host livestreams due to lack of time, expertise, or budget to hire a live host.

## üí° Our Solution

At **LLAMA Hackathon 2025**, we introduce **Lisa**, the AI Live Shopping Host. Lisa is a virtual livestream presenter that:

- Runs a livestream on the seller‚Äôs behalf
- Generates dynamic, engaging product intros using seller-provided data
- Interacts with viewers in real time
- Responds to comments and questions automatically
- Maximizes conversion ‚Äî without seller intervention

This is a step toward democratizing live commerce for all.

## üé• Demo Flow

1. **Upload Product Data via Seller Portal**
   - Seller provides product specs, user reviews, FAQs, etc.
   - We use this data to ground Lisa‚Äôs knowledge base.
